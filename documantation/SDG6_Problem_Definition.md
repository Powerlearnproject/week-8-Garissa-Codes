# SDG Problem Definition Document

## **1. Introduction**
### **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**
SDG 6 aims to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all by 2030. This goal is critical as water scarcity, poor water quality, and inadequate sanitation negatively impact health, education, and economic development globally.

## **2. Problem Statement**
### **Water Accessibility Challenges in Northern Kenya**
Northern Kenya faces significant water accessibility challenges due to:
- **Limited Water Sources:** Many communities rely on seasonal rivers and boreholes that dry up during droughts.
- **Long Distances to Water Sources:** Households often travel 5â€“10 km daily to fetch water.
- **Poor Water Quality:** High contamination levels from bacteria, chemicals, and unsafe storage lead to health risks.
- **Seasonal Variability:** Water availability fluctuates drastically between wet and dry seasons, making supply unreliable.
- **Health Impacts:** Frequent outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid due to unsafe drinking water.

## **3. Significance of the Problem**
- **Health Impact:** Unsafe water leads to a high prevalence of waterborne diseases, affecting community well-being.
- **Economic Burden:** Time spent collecting water reduces productivity and education opportunities, especially for women and children.
- **Sustainability Concerns:** Unreliable water supply affects agriculture, livestock, and overall livelihoods in the region.
- **Data Gaps:** Lack of real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making worsens the inefficiencies in water resource management.

## **4. Proposed Solution**
A **data-driven approach** to improving water accessibility in Northern Kenya, using:
- **Relational Database:** To track water sources, quality, household access, and seasonal variations.
- **SQL Data Analysis:** To identify trends in water availability, contamination levels, and health impact.
- **Excel Dashboard:** To visualize key insights for stakeholders, enabling better decision-making.
- **Integration & Monitoring:** Using real-time data to enhance water source management and policy interventions.

## **5. Expected Impact**
- **Improved Water Access:** Identify underserved communities and optimize resource allocation.
- **Enhanced Water Quality Monitoring:** Reduce health risks by tracking contamination trends.
- **Better Policy Decisions:** Support local governments and NGOs with data-backed recommendations.
- **Community Empowerment:** Enable residents to make informed choices about water usage and sanitation practices.

## **6. Conclusion**
Addressing water accessibility issues in Northern Kenya through **data-driven insights** can significantly improve health, economic opportunities, and sustainability. This project aligns with SDG 6 by providing **real-time monitoring, improved access, and actionable insights** to create long-term solutions for water security.
